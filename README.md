Hello and welcome to the Julia community!

This is a good place for beginners to start. Feel free to read about [common words we use in our glossary](), [how to make a PR](), and much more. 

Happy Hacking!

### Glossary

Hello, I have started this document as a handy glossary to point to for beginners. Generally intended for English as a Second Language Speakers or new users of online forums and the Julia Community in general.


|        Terms        |    Meaning   |
|:-------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------:|
| foo / bar / bazz    | These terms are used to give an example of what is being discussed, and the names don't actually mater. For example, `foo(bar.txt)` means that there is some function that will be called on a text file, but the names don't really matter at the moment. |
| AFAIK               |  As Far As I Know |
| MWE                 | Minimum Working Example. [A piece of code to reproduce your problem on someone else's machine](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/psa-make-it-easier-to-help-you/) .|
| LGTM                | Looks Good To Me |
| YMMV                | Your Mileage May Vary, an abbrevaited way to say "Your experience may be different than mine". |
| IIUC                | If I Understand Correctly |
| AFAIK               | As Far As I Know |
| IANAL               | I Am Not A Lawyer  |
| PR                  | Pull Request (see Git) |
| REPL | Read Evaluate Print Loop, also known as that terminal / dark window when you open up Julia for the first time. Very useful for experimenting with you Julia codes. |
| TIL                 | Today I Learned |
| GC                  | Garbage Collector. An algorithm that helps manage the memory needed for Julia to run. |
| LLVM                | Julia's compiler. As a beginner, its enough to know that a compiler takes code, transforms it, and ideally makes it faster. |
| GSOC                | Google Summer of Code. Happens once a year in June - August. Google pays students to code in Julia |
| COC                 | Julia's Code of Conduct. |
| Slack               | An online chatting forum that permits talking in different #channels, with emojis and some code formatting. Messages get auto deleted after a while. |
| [Discourse](https;//discourse.julialang.org)           | Usually suited towards longer form discussions. |
| Zulip               | An online chatting forum like Slack, but open source, and permanent history. |
| GitHub / issue tags | A web page where most of Julia codes are freely hosted. People usually discuss code designs and submit Pull Requests here. |
| Meetups             | When Julians meet each other in person. Usually location based with some scheduling. See [the calendar for your local ones]() |
| Triage              | A call with Julia devs who focus on internal issues of how Julia works. Open to all, heavy technical knowledge. |
| Community Calendar     |         A place where meetups, calls, conventions and other Julia-related events are announced. [Link is here](https://julialang.org/community/#events) |
| JuliaCon            | A once a year conference that happens somewhere in the world. People present posters, presentations and share their code. Almost all material is easily accessible on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAxzR7lMGDM&t=3s). |
| Ship it!            |           A phrase to publish some code, usually with some bravery. |
| #general            |             A chatting channel on Slack/Zulip where things of general Julia interest are discussed.|
| #random             |         A chatting channel on Slack/Zulip where things are more casual and people post about random things, like the latest computer chips or a cool new video gets shared |
| #introduction | |
| #helpdesk           | A place where you can ask even the most basic questions about working with Julia and volunteers will try to help. Very useful to read [how to get help](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/psa-make-it-easier-to-help-you/) before. Also consider that people do this for free, so please be kind. |
| #community          |              A channel to coordinate community events like meetups, conferences, etc. |
| #diversity          |                  A place to discuss efforts towards the inclusion of marginalized people within the Julia community |

| Moderator           |                          Moderator here on Discourse. People who help keep spam away and interactions friendly and productive. |
| Steward             |                 Julia long time community members who take actions about faults with the CoC by community members. Not their day job, not their favorite job, not a thankful job, but rewarding for the community at large since this almost all online communities need to enforce some rules. |
| bump (an issue)                |              To recomment on a github issue or topic so that it gains attention again. Usually well intentioned if someone committed to working on the code and hasn't reported back in a while and it would be useful to know the current status of it. |
| ping                |                      To mention someone like @this so that they get a notification. |
| necroposting        |          To find a post in a forum like Discourse that hasn't been touched upon in quite a while and try to restart the conversation. Usually not seen in a positive light, some topics need to be moved on from. |
